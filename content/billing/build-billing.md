Hydrobuild is a next-generation build tool that enables improved build speed, a shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. Hydrobuild is available for free with an existing Docker subscription. To buy additional seats and increase your available build minutes, you can buy a subscription to enhance your builds.

In this section, learn how to set up and manage billing for your Hydrobuild subscription. To learn about the subscription tiers, see [Hydrobuild subscriptions and features](../subscription/build-details.md).

## Buy your subscription

1. Go to the [Docker Cloud Build dashboard](https://www.build.docker.com). If you're not already signed in to your Docker account, do so now.
2. Choose the user account you want to use to subscribe. This can be a personal account, or an organization account. To buy a subscription for an organization, you need to be an organization owner.
3. Review the plans, then select **Buy now**.
4. For organizations: Select the number of seats you want to buy, then select **Continue to payment**.
5. Review your order, then enter your payment information and select **Subscribe**.

Subscriptions charge monthly to the default payment method.
