### New

The new features in this release are:

- [Device code login](#device-code-login)
- [Multi-platform support for `docker image ls`](#multi-platform-support-for-docker-image-ls)

#### Device code login

This release adds support for using device code login when authenticating to
Docker Hub.

You can still use the old method of logging in with a username and password or
access token, but device code login is more secure and doesn't require you to
enter your password in the CLI.

To use the old method, use `docker login -u <username>`.

#### Multi-platform support for `docker image ls`

{{< experimental >}}
This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward compatibility.
{{< /experimental >}}

With the containerd image store enabled, the `docker image ls` command (or
`docker images` shorthand) now supports a `--tree` flag that now shows
if an image is a multi-platform image.

### API

- `GET /images/json` response now includes `Manifests` field, which contains information about the sub-manifests included in the image index. This includes things like platform-specific manifests and build attestations.

  The new field will only be populated if the request also sets the `manifests` query parameter to `true`.

### Bug fixes and enhancements

- CLI: Fix issue with remote contexts over SSH where the CLI would allocate a pseudo-TTY when connecting to the remote host, which causes issues in rare situations. [docker/cli#5351](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5351)
- Fix an issue that prevented network creation with a `--ip-range` ending on a 64-bit boundary. [moby/moby#48326](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48326)
- CLI: IPv6 addresses shown by `docker ps` in port bindings are now bracketed. [docker/cli#5365](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5365)
- containerd image store: Fix early error exit from `docker load` in cases where unpacking the image would fail. [moby/moby#48376](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48376)
- containerd image store: Fix the previous image not being persisted as dangling after `docker pull`. [moby/moby#48380](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48380)
