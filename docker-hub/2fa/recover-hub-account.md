If you have lost your two-factor authentication device and need to access your
Docker Hub account, you can gain access to your account using your two-factor
authentication recovery code.

## Prerequisites

Two-factor authentication is enabled on your Docker Hub account and you have
your two-factor authentication recovery code.

> If you lose both your 2FA authentication device and recovery code, you may
> not be able to recover your account.

your recovery code, get in touch with our Support team using the [Contact Support form](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/?category=2fa-lockout){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}. You must enter the primary email address associated with your Docker ID in the Contact Support form for recovery instructions.
